Vim on Windows 
========================
This is mostly intended as a note to myself, describing how I set up my programming environment in windows 8 using the following:
*Cygwin with the mintty terminal
*Custom vimrc
*Solarized color palette for both vim and mintty
*Sourcepro font


Using Vim in Cygwin-Mintty, custom .vimrc, Solarized palette and Sourcepro font
