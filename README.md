Vim on Windows 
========================
This is mostly intended as a note to myself, describing how I set up my programming environment in windows 8 using the following:
* **Cygwin** with the mintty terminal
* **Vim** Custom vimrc
* **Solarized** color palette for both vim and mintty
* **Sourcepro font**
