Vim on Windows 
========================
This is mostly intended as a note to myself, describing how I set up my programming environment in windows 8 using the following:
* **Cygwin** with the mintty terminal
* **Vim** Custom vimrc
* **Solarized** color palette for both vim and mintty
* **Sourcepro font**

This is more a collection of links, install instructions will be in the links.

## Cygwin
Get [latest version](https://cygwin.com/install.html), mintty should be included. During the Cygwin installation remember to tick of Vim as a package to be installed. The installer can be run again to update Cygwin or install new packages.

A few useful things one can install this way:
* **Vim**
* **gcc**
* **tex**

## [Vimrc](http://amix.dk/vim/vimrc.html)
Copied Amir Salihefendics vimrc and made some minor additions.

## [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)
A nice color palette, need to be installed separately for vim and mintty:
* **Vim**: https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized
* **Mintty**: https://github.com/mavnn/mintty-colors-solarized 

Even thought you only want Solarized in Vim, iff you use Vim in terminal mode, you will need the palette colors in the terminal as well.

## [Sourcepro font](https://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?event=displayFontPackage&code=1959)
